# Single-cell signalling dynamics of p53 in the context of DNA-damage
Time-series analysis techniques, clustering algorithms and mathematical modelling of long-term fluorescent microscopy recordings of single cells exhibiting p53 dynamics. This work aims to improve understanding of the effects of molecular mechanisms on DNA damage response and its relation to cell phenotypes.
